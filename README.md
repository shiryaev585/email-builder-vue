## Introduction

This project is a free and open-source port of [EmailBuilder.js](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js) for Vue.js developers.
Faithfully adapted from the original EmailBuilder.js to bring the same experience to Vue.js projects.

[Use the original playground](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder) or learn more about how to [get started using EmailBuilder.js](#using-emailbuilder.js-(vue.js-port)).

## Build simple welcome emails to complex reports

Use a no-code builder that is flexible enough to create a wide variety of template designs – from simple welcome emails to complex reports.

![Image of example templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/refs/heads/main/images/template.png)

Sample templates available in the playground:

- [Welcome email](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/welcome)
- [One-time passcode (OTP)](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/one-time-password)
- [Reset password](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reset-password)
- [E-commerce receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/order-ecomerce)
- [SaaS subscription receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/subscription-receipt)
- [Reservation reminder](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder)
- [Post metrics](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/post-metrics-report)
- [Respond to inquiry](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/respond-to-message)

## Why?

It's finally time to stop using 90's style HTML and CSS to build product emails. EmailBuilder.js (Vue.js Port) takes inspiration from [editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) and email component libraries and puts them into an easy to use no-code builder to allow the entire team to build emails.

Since this Vue.js port is also free and open-source, teams can self-host and extend it as needed.

<br>

## Built-in blocks

Note: This list of blocks is based on the original EmailBuilder.js. This port is not yet complete.

Each block is its own npm package that can be included in the builder. These are the ones that are built-in:

- [Avatar](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-avatar)
- [Button](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-button)
- [Columns Container](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-columns-container)
- [Container](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-container)
- [Divider](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-divider)
- [Heading](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-heading)
- [HTML](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-html)
- [Image](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-image)
- [Spacer](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-spacer)
- [Text](https://github.com/flyhub-dev/email-builder-vue/tree/main/packages/block-text)

<br>

## Email client support

All blocks are [tested and supported](https://www.usewaypoint.com/docs/email-client-support) by modern email clients (on both desktop and mobile) including: Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY and Superhuman.

## Email builder output

The email builder can output to a clean JSON or raw HTML. You can see this from the playground by simply clicking on the HTML or JSON tabs in the builder.

## Using EmailBuilder.js (Vue.js Port)

Install the package in your project:

```bash
npm install --save @flyhub/email-builder
```

Given an EmailBuilder.js (Vue.js Port) configuration (the JSON output of the builder):

```javascript
import { TReaderDocument } from '@flyhub/email-builder';

const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {
  root: {
    type: 'EmailLayout',
    data: {
      backdropColor: '#F8F8F8',
      canvasColor: '#FFFFFF',
      textColor: '#242424',
      fontFamily: 'MODERN_SANS',
      childrenIds: ['block-1709578146127'],
    },
  },
  'block-1709578146127': {
    type: 'Text',
    data: {
      style: {
        fontWeight: 'normal',
        padding: {
          top: 16,
          bottom: 16,
          right: 24,
          left: 24,
        },
      },
      props: {
        text: 'Hello world',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

You can render the EmailBuilder.js (Vue.js Port) configuration to an HTML email string:

```javascript
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@flyhub/email-builder';

const string = renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' });
```

Or you can render the EmailBuilder.js (Vue.js Port) configuration by using the `<Reader />` Vue component:

```vue
<template>
  <Reader :document="CONFIGURATION" root-block-id="root" />;
</template>

<script setup>
import { Reader } from '@flyhub/email-builder';
</script>
```

## Sending emails

In most cases, you'll want to take the EmailBuilder.js (Vue.js Port) configuration, render it to HTML, and then send it as an email. Here are a couple of examples on how you can do this using the same configuration from the examples above.

<br>

### Sending through nodemailer

```javascript
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@flyhub/email-builder';
import nodemailer from "nodemailer";

// Replace this with your transport configuration
const transportConfig = {}
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(transportConfig);

// Replace this with the JSON for your Reader document
const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {}

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: 'no-reply@example.com'
  to: 'friend@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello',
  html: renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' }),
});
```

<br>

### Sending through an email API

We'll use [Waypoint](https://www.usewaypoint.com) for this example, however, you can use any email API like Amazon SES, SendGrid, or MailGun.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@flyhub/email-builder';

// TODO: Replace this with the JSON for your Reader document
const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {/* your config here */}

await axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://live.waypointapi.com/v1/email_messages',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  auth: {
    username: API_KEY_USERNAME,
    password: API_KEY_PASSWORD,
  },

  data: {
    from: 'no-reply@example.com'
    to: 'friend@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello',
    bodyHtml: renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' }),
  },
});
```
